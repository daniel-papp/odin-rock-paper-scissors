### JavaScript Basics Project: Rock Paper Scissors

In this project I create a Rock Paper Scissors game where one can play against the computer.

The main goal of the project is to practice the fundamental **JavaScript** concepts, such as variables, loops, conditionals and functions. While creating a graphical user interface for the game, is also a great opportunity to reinforce the **HTML** and **CSS** that I learned so far.
